Introduction
============

DASH is a GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics software package designed for both atomistic and coarse grained simulations.  DASH is controlled via a powerful python interface, which gives the user full control to set up, modify, and analyze simulations all within one script.  

DASH uses the SETTLE algorithm (Miyamoto, JCC, 1992) to efficiently model water molecules.  In addition to standard water potentials such as TIP3P, TIP4P and similar, DASH includes the new E3B water model (Tainter, JCP, 2011), which has been parameterized to accurately capture much of the water phase diagram.
